# react-json-view-antd
RJVD is a React component for displaying and editing javascript **arrays** and **JSON objects** leveraging ant design.

This project is a fork of [react-json-view](https://github.com/mac-s-g/react-json-view) project.
Please consult it for further details and API documentation.

I'm also inspired by users who come up with interesting feature requests.  Reach out to me with ideas for this project or other projects you want to collaborate on.
